title: Design to 3D Print in 30 Minutes
excerpt: "Diving deeper into 3D printing. Decided to create a china step buckle for a bag that broke, during covid would have taken long to arrive. A new mountain bike mount, snowboard mount and also a 30 minute design to print challenge."

# First Creation
Thingaverse is the amazon of 3D printing. After some test prints I was comfortable with the process so headed towards the creating my own designs. I am using a Creality Ender-3 with black PLA. I seem to find 0.25 a sweet spot for most prints, and if the model isnt required to be too detailed then 0.3 saves some time. The main issues encountered include;
1. Bed leveling not correct, the print head is too close to the bed so cannot print correctly and get a good level of spread when being applied. Annoyingly I found every print would require a new level or point 2 would occur
2. PLA Jamming, the feeder would click and this would suggest it couldnt feed the print tip the spool due to a blockage. This would turn out to be the longest thing to fix, requiring taking the PLA out of the heated end and reapplying a fresh feed of PLA after unblocking with a needle. 

**Print Duration** 
All depends on the fill rate and the end product application. Smallest print was a screw test which took 20 minutes and the longest being 18 hours for the first iteration of the bike wall mount

## 3D Modeling
Initially over lunch I crafted a door opener with a stylus on the end. This was created in Autodesk Maya and then exported as a .stl file for printing. Cura was used to slice the model, the print wasn't correct however due to an error that I would soon be familiar with 

**WARNING** 
Your model is not manifold. The highlighted areas indicate either missing or extraneous surfaces.

Discovered complex models are tricky to solve manifold where vertex faces dont align as expected with so explored other 3D modeling options. Having experience with inventor I tried Fusion 360 as it looked like a more minimal version. 

First model was the china step buckle design which was a success and got to grips with the CAD concepts again as its more or less 2D drawing on x,y,z transforms and extruding vs vertex manipulation. Better accuracy, longer period of time to model.

### Bike Wall Mount

The next a bike mount. Haven't seen this design anywhere and it is solving a real issue in my life. Ran some simulation tests using "plastic" material in Fusion 360, took a while and never really got a definitive result so ended up mounting the v2 print on a plaster board and then put some weights in a bag and hoped for the best. I live in an apartment and have no access to safely secure my now quite fancy mountain bike, this mount keeps tyres off the floor and will fit any bike. Also removing the wheels will allow for less space taken up by the bike itself.
