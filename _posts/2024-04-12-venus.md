title: Experience Venus in VR Chat
excerpt: "We competed in a VRC game jam Sponsored by the NSSA, VRC hosted a month long game jam for the community to develop ideas regarding humans colonizing and living in space. After research, Venus was an interesting topic. Rather than O'Neil or Mars.. or Lunar habitats, there is a good amount of effort already put into humans on Venus by NASA so lets dive in for 2 weeks with a team."

## Official Selection
As of 01/05/2024 we have a total of 35,000 visits and over 3,000 world favourites. A great result showing 10% favourite ratio. The world features a ride in a blimp at the start which showcases the venus atmosphere and arrival into one of the larger floating citites. In here you can explore a small museum with a planetarium with orbits of our solar system to scale. Concept venus rovers are also modeled based on NASA schematics, with additional concepts developed by myself.
