## Intro
The experience showcases;
A short video player with a blur effect for the screen. The Slider is a placeholder for something I havent integrated yet. Launch a Saturn V rocket. See why filters are great at improving accuracy. The controller will flick a little and I havent adjusted values entirely but you will get to experience ray input with a 1-Euro Filter enabled. You can also see a simple implementation of a reference frame to help VR players find points of interest. 

> Its an offline application in both builds.
