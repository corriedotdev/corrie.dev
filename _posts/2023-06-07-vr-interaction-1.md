title: "Modular 3D Interfaces for Accessible VR Applications"
excerpt: "Published in Springer Nature VR Book, im going to go over the main points of the framework Ive developed so you can create a UI that supports an accessible first design approach while also supporting multimodal input, future proofing your UI for all input mediums."

## Intro
The paper has been published in Springer notes which can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-35634-6_2) the pre-print is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10541). This page will cover the basics of the system to allow you to integrate into your own projects. I would recommend watching the youtube video, which is a more "entertaining" version of the presentation I did at HCI International 2023.

## Key Features
Existing interfaces are not, if ever, designed with accessibility in mind. It's a difficult thing for developers to implement as its not clear on exactly what makes a design accessible. This interface has been developed with an accessible first design philosophy, aiming to remove this responsibility from the developer allowing for a multimodal input approach allowing users to select their preferred input mechanism whilst also providing support for relocating the positions of UI elements. 

- Free-floating allows for adjustment in 6-DOF for users with specific viewing angle requirements and allows for anchored placement in 3D space.

- Contextual, allowing elements to only be displayed when relevant to the location in the environment resulting in;

- Predictable task-focused interactions, using skeuomorphs and colors around 3D interface trims in designated context zones

## Demo Download 
The [Github repo](https://github.com/corriedotdev/vr-modular-3d-gui) you can download various demonstrations of the application. You can integrate this into your project by creating a panel with a border that allows for grabbable interactions. The

> Panels with borders which act as buffer zones to prevent interacting with UI componenets attached

> The panels are kinematic and work with the physics engine allowing for static placement but also interact with the envionment
