#  The Future of Programming
Initially when watching this presentation I just lacked the humour, I really have no idea what on earth the audience was laughing at I didn't find it funny but I digress.

The nature of adopting ideas leads into the brain of not adopting new ways of thinking, brains are slow but computers are fast. People need to adopt to new ideas. Lots of resistance to new ways of working, unlearning what you know and approaching a new technique. Such as going from machine code to SOAP (Assembly.) Soon after SOAP was replaced with FORTRAN. There is resistance to learning a new language or method of adopting new ideas.

##4 Ideas
- Coding -> Direct Manipulation of Data
- Procedures -> goals and constraints
- Text Dump -> spatial representation (here is where I can forsee VR being used as another spatial representation)
- Sequential -> concurrent

The concept of drawing into code, markup languages and stylesheet will be dead as its all direct manipulation of some graphical representation. Expressing your program on what you want it to do, not how you do it. 
This reminds me of GPT-2 where demos have been shown with descriptions being provided and then the output is the working visual code. I would say that hooking up the arithmetic is harder, but visually I can see the concept working more for UI designers. Feed in constraints to GPT-2 and ask it for a simple menu with a button x, y. This is pattern matching. Sketchpads, constraints, pattern matching are providing high level goals to the computer to solve.

J.C.R Licklidar has a theory for the "intergalactic computer network." A web of all the computers linked together to fulfill tasks.

The concept of programs becoming satinet and communicating to fulfill a purpose is sexy however I cant imagine how it would work (yet.) Ideally just having json being the data that is being passed to the application layer of the services then I can see this working. Perhaps the services have automated test cases to fulfill before accepting and understanding the purpose of the other program. There is an intermediary step to accept and acknowledge the program being interfaced with is the correct one by automating test cases. 

# Figuring out procedure communication
If we present a calculator 1+1 we get 2, so lets present this data to services until we get 2. Edge case over to one plus one will fail, this program wont work due to int string (ignore generics for this example.) But finding an text to in program to use first, we can then get the desired output. This seems computationally complex and would be O^2 if we dont ever tell the system where to look for int to text or that it is a requirement, but with a global network of computers with immense computing power I could see it perhaps running through numerous program types to fulfill the purpose, obviously categorizing programs with expected ins and outs im just toying with the concept here. 

However the talk removes the thought of API's such as JSON in general and requires goals as the driving force behind exchange of data between systems.

## Spatial Representation (My Research)
- Text Dump -> Spatial Representation 

Punch cards are good for displaying text, tele-prompts,  all good for reading 'text dumps' but we now use monitors which have this other layer of spatial ability.

NLS (Online System)

How can we represent this dynamic information spatially. The context menu used in the presentation is looking at a drop down list and then visualized in a node linked tree mesh
